      <div class="guide__text">
        <p>
          The capital of the United Kingdom is a thriving multicultural metropolis. The contrast between the spectacular
          historic sights and the lively cultural scene makes a visit to London an interesting and exciting adventure.
          Wander through St. James park, visit Westminster Abbey, explore the streets of Shoreditch, and take a ride up
          the River Thames. London's incredible shopping, endless sights, friendly locals, and vibrant nightlife offer
          something for every kind of traveler. Here's my ultimate London travel guide with all my tips for planning
          your
          trip to England!

    <h4 class="guide__subtitle">Things to Do</h4>
    <div class="guide__text">
      <p><span class="highlight">Westminster Abbey - </span>
        A splendid mixture of architectural styles, Westminster Abbey is considered the finest example of Early English
        Gothic. It's not merely a beautiful place of worship – the Abbey is still a working church and the stage on
        which history unfolds. For centuries, the country's greatest have been interred here, including 17 monarchs from
        King Henry III (1272) to King George II (1760). Much of the Abbey's architecture is from the 13th century, but
        it was founded much earlier, in AD 960.
      </p>
      <p><span class="highlight">Natural History Museum - </span>
        On a vast 5.7 hectare plot and housing 80 million specimens, this colossal and magnificent building is infused
        with the irrepressible Victorian spirit of collecting, cataloguing and interpreting the natural world. The
        Dinosaurs Gallery (Blue Zone) is a must for children, who gawp at the animatronic T-rex. Adults will love the
        intriguing Treasures exhibition in the Cadogan Gallery (Green Zone), which displays a host of unrelated objects,
        each telling its own unique story, from a chunk of moon rock to a dodo skeleton.
      </p>
      <p><span class="highlight">Tower of London - </span>
        The unmissable Tower of London offers a window into 1000 years of gruesome and compelling history. A former
        royal residence, treasury, mint, armoury and zoo, it's perhaps most remembered as the prison where a king, three
        queens and many nobles met their deaths. The immaculately dressed Yeomen Warders (better known as the
        Beefeaters) who live on site, protect the spectacular Crown Jewels, containing the biggest diamonds in the
        world, and lead tours of the Tower, as soothsaying resident ravens flit overhead.
      </p>
      <p><span class="highlight">British Museum - </span>
        The British Museum is the country's most popular museum (around 5.8 million visitors annually) and one of the
        world's oldest (opened in 1759). Don't miss the Rosetta Stone, the key to deciphering Egyptian hieroglyphics
        (head upstairs for the Egyptian mummies); the controversial Parthenon sculptures, taken from Athens' Acropolis
        by Lord Elgin (British ambassador to the Ottoman Empire); and the vast Etruscan, Greek, Roman, European, Asian
        and Islamic galleries. It's been acknowledged work needs to be done on the Americas collection.

      <h4 class="guide__subtitle">About Tokyo</h4>
      <div class="guide__text">
        <p>
          In Tokyo you can experience the whole breadth of Japanese arts and culture. Centuries-old forms of performing
          arts still play on stages and sumo tournaments draw crowds; every spring, Tokyoites head outside to appreciate
          the cherry blossoms – a tradition older than the city itself. There are museums covering every era of Japanese
          art history and also ones that focus on the contemporary – challenging the old distinctions between art with a
          capital A, pop culture and technology. But there's a playful side to all of this, too: Tokyo is, after all, a
          city whose public artworks include a scale model of an anime robot.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h4 class="guide__subtitle">Things to Do</h4>
    <div class="guide__text">
      <p><span class="highlight">Sensō-ji Temple - </span>
        Tokyo’s most visited temple enshrines a golden image of Kannon (the Buddhist goddess of mercy), which, according
        to legend, was miraculously pulled out of the nearby Sumida-gawa by two fishermen in AD 628. The image has
        remained on the spot ever since but is never on public display. The present structure dates from 1958.
        Sensō-ji is always busy, particularly on weekends; consider visiting in the evening to see it with fewer people
        and the buildings beautifully illuminated.
      </p>
      <p><span class="highlight">Tokyo National Museum - </span>
        If you visit only one museum in Tokyo, make it the Tokyo National Museum. Here you'll find the world's largest
        collection of Japanese art, including ancient pottery, Buddhist sculptures, samurai swords, colourful ukiyo-e
        (woodblock prints), gorgeous kimonos and much, much more. Visitors with only a couple of hours to spare should
        focus on the Honkan (Japanese Gallery), which has a specially curated selection of artistic highlights on the
        2nd floor.
      </p>
      <p><span class="highlight">Golden Gai Street - </span>
        A Shinjuku institution for over half a century – is a collection of tiny bars, often literally no
        bigger than a closet and seating maybe a dozen. Each is as unique and eccentric as the ‘master’ or ‘mama’ who
        runs it. In a sense, Golden Gai, which has a strong visual appeal, with its low-slung wooden buildings, is their
        work of art. It's more than just a place to drink.
      </p>
      <p><span class="highlight">Meiji-jingū (Shinto Shrine) - </span>
        Tokyo’s grandest Shintō shrine is dedicated to the Emperor Meiji and Empress Shōken, whose reign (1868–1912)
        coincided with Japan's transformation from isolationist, feudal state to modern nation. Constructed in 1920, the
        shrine was destroyed in WWII air raids and rebuilt in 1958; however, unlike so many of Japan’s postwar
        reconstructions, Meiji-jingū has atmosphere in spades. Note that the shrine is currently undergoing renovations
        bit by bit in preparation for its 100th anniversary, but will remain open.

      <h4 class="guide__subtitle">About Paris</h4>
      <div class="guide__text">
        <p>
          Paris' monument-lined boulevards, museums, classical bistros and boutiques are enhanced by a new wave of
          multimedia galleries, creative wine bars, design shops and tech start-ups. The cloud-piercing, wrought-iron
          Eiffel Tower, broad Arc de Triomphe guarding the glamorous avenue des
          Champs-Élysées, flying buttressed Notre Dame cathedral, lamplit bridges spanning the Seine and art nouveau
          cafes' wicker-chair-lined terraces are enduring Parisian emblems. Despite initial appearances, however, Paris’
          cityscape isn’t static: there are some stunning modern and contemporary icons, too, from the inside-out,
          industrial-style Centre Pompidou to the mur végétal (vertical garden) gracing the Musée du Quai Branly, the
          glass sails of the Fondation Louis Vuitton contemporary-art centre, and the gleaming steel egg-shaped concert
          venue La Seine Musicale.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h4 class="guide__subtitle">Things to Do</h4>
    <div class="guide__text">
      <p><span class="highlight">Eiffel Tower - </span>
        No one could imagine Paris today without its signature spire. But Gustave Eiffel only constructed this 324m-tall
        tower as a temporary exhibit for the 1889 World's Fair. Luckily, the art nouveau tower’s popularity assured its
        survival. Prebook online to avoid extensive ticket queues.
        Lifts ascend to the tower’s three floors; change on the 2nd floor for the final ascent to the top. Energetic
        visitors can climb as far as the 2nd floor via the south pillar’s 720 stairs (no prebooking).
      </p>
      <p><span class="highlight">Louvre Museum - </span>
        It isn’t until you’re standing in the vast courtyard of the Louvre, with sunlight shimmering through the glass
        pyramid and crowds milling about beneath the museum’s ornate façade, that you can truly say you’ve been to
        Paris. Holding tens of thousands of works of art – from Mesopotamian, Egyptian and Greek antiquities to
        masterpieces by artists such as da Vinci (including his incomparable Mona Lisa), Michelangelo and Rembrandt –
        it’s no surprise that this is one of the world’s most visited museums.
      </p>
      <p><span class="highlight">Jardin du Luxembourg - </span>
        This inner-city oasis of formal terraces, chestnut groves and lush lawns has a special place in Parisians'
        hearts. Napoléon dedicated the 23 gracefully laid-out hectares of the Luxembourg Gardens to the children of
        Paris, and many residents spent their childhood prodding 1920s wooden sailboats with long sticks on the
        octagonal Grand Bassin pond, watching puppets perform puppet shows at the Théâtre du Luxembourg and riding the
        carrousel (merry-go-round) or ponies.
      </p>
      <p><span class="highlight">Notre-Dame Cathedral - </span>
        While its interior is closed off to visitors following the devastating fire of April 2019, this masterpiece of
        French Gothic architecture remains the city’s geographic and spiritual heart. Its grand exterior, with its two
        enduring towers and flying buttresses, is rightly still an alluring attraction to countless visitors.
      </p>
      <p><span class="highlight">Arc de Triomphe - </span>
        If anything rivals the Eiffel Tower as the symbol of Paris, it’s this magnificent 1836 monument to Napoléon’s
        victory at Austerlitz (1805), which he commissioned the following year. The intricately sculpted triumphal arch
        stands sentinel in the centre of the Étoile (Star) roundabout. From the viewing platform on top of the arch (50m
        up via 284 steps and well worth the climb) you can see the dozen avenues.

      <div class="guide__text">
        <p>
          During any season, at any hour of the day, Moscow thrills visitors with its artistry, history and majesty.
          The very founding site of the city (and arguably, the country), the Kremlin and Red Square are still at the
          heart of Moscow – historically, geographically and spiritually. Feel the weight of this significance as you
          wander within the walls of the ancient fortress, marvel at the mind-boggling magnificence of St Basil's
          Cathedral and pay your respects to the revered leader of a now-defunct state. Moscow will move you. It will
          tantalise your senses, soothe your spirit and boggle your mind – and it all starts right here at the Kremlin
          and
          Red Square.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h4 class="guide__subtitle">Things to Do</h4>
    <div class="guide__text">
      <p><span class="highlight">St Basil's Cathedral - </span>
        At the southern end of Red Square stands the icon of Russia: St Basil’s Cathedral. This crazy confusion of
        colours, patterns and shapes is the culmination of a style that is unique to Russian architecture. In 1552 Ivan
        the Terrible captured the Tatar stronghold of Kazan on the Feast of Intercession. He commissioned this landmark
        church, officially the Intercession Cathedral, to commemorate the victory. Created from 1555 to 1561, this
        masterpiece would become the ultimate symbol of Russia.
      </p>
      <p><span class="highlight">Moscow Kremlin - </span>
        The apex of Russian political power and once the centre of the Orthodox Church, the Kremlin is the kernel of not
        only Moscow, but of the whole country. From here, autocratic tsars, communist dictators and modern-day
        presidents have done their best – and worst – for Russia.
        Covering Borovitsky Hill on the Moscow River's north bank, it's enclosed by high walls 2.25km long (Red Square's
        outside the east wall). The best views of the complex are from Sofiyskaya nab across the river.
      </p>
      <p><span class="highlight">Red Square - </span>
        Immediately outside the Kremlin’s northeastern wall is the celebrated Red Square, the 400m-by-150m area of
        cobblestones that is at the very heart of Moscow. Commanding the square from the southern end is St Basil’s
        Cathedral. This panorama never fails to send the heart aflutter, especially at night.
        Next to the cathedral, an elevated platform, known as the Place of Skulls, was used for reading out decrees and
        proclamations in the old ages and became the setting for Pussy Riot's anti-Putin video clip in 2011. Nearby, the
        Minin & Pozharsky Statue celebrates the heroes of the 1612 liberation war against the Poles.
      </p>
      <p><span class="highlight">Bolshoi Theatre - </span>
        An evening at the Bolshoi is still one of Moscow’s most romantic and entertaining options for a night on the
        town. The glittering six-tier auditorium has an electric atmosphere, evoking over 240 years of premier music and
        dance. Both the ballet and opera companies perform a range of Russian and foreign works here.
        After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Bolshoi was marred by politics, scandal and frequent turnover.
        Nevertheless, it has been churning out splendid and daringly experimental performances at an astonishing pace.
