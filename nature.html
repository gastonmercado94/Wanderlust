                <p>
                    Friendly and food-obsessed, hedonistic and historic, cultured and curious, Thailand tempts visitors
                    with a smile as golden as the country's glittering temples and tropical beaches. The celestial world
                    is a close confidant in this Buddhist nation, and religious devotion is colourful and ubiquitous.
                    Gleaming temples and golden Buddhas frame both the rural and the urban landscape. Also, With a
                    luxuriously long coastline (actually, two coastlines) and over 1400 jungle-topped islands anchored
                    in azure waters, Thailand is a tropical getaway fit for everyone, whether hedonist or hermit, prince
                    or pauper.

            <div class="guide__text">
                <p><span class="highlight">Bangkok - </span>
                    Glittering temples, towering skyscrapers, a dynamic nightlife and, oh â€“ the food! What's not to love
                    about Bangkok? Traffic jams, humidity and political instability aside, the Thai capital is now
                    tidier and easier to navigate than ever. Zip between golden shrines, colourful markets, glitzy
                    mega-malls and fascinating museums, stopping to refuel at sizzling street-side food stands and some
                    of Asia's best restaurants. Head up to one of the city's famous rooftop bars on your first night to
                    get your bearings in this heaving, twinkling metropolis, and prepare to dive straight in.
                </p>
                <p><span class="highlight">Chiang Mai - </span>
                    The cultural capital of the north, Chiang Mai is beloved by culture geeks, temple-spotters and
                    families. The old city is jam-packed with temples born during the time of the once independent Lanna
                    kingdom. These and the area's winding side roads are best explored on bicycle. Cooking schools teach
                    visitors the art of Thai food, while the scenic countryside boasts jungle treks, elephant encounters
                    and minority villages. The city enjoys fantastic dining thanks to imports such as Japanese sushi and
                    Burmese curries, plus home-grown northern specialities and vegetarian fare. The surrounding areas
                    are rich with traditional handicraft outlets. </p>
                <p><span class="highlight">Railay Beach - </span>
                    At the tip of the Krabi peninsula are some of Thailand's most famous natural features: the soaring
                    limestone karsts of Railay, anchored in the ocean. The beaches are sugar-white and the forested
                    interior is traversed by foot traffic, not cars. No traffic jams, no transport hassles. Visitors
                    come and go by long-tail boats. Come to lounge, swim, dive or rock-climb. Beginners can learn basic
                    skills, and some stay so long they get good enough to do a free solo on a pinnacle then fall
                    harmlessly into a cobalt sea.
                </p>
                <p><span class="highlight">Khao Yai National Park - </span>
                    This park is home to elephants, monkeys, gibbons, hornbills, pythons, bears, a million bats and even
                    a few wily tigers. Wildlife sightings are mostly at the mercy of chance, but your odds are excellent
                    at this vast Unesco-listed reserve, just a few hours out of Bangkok. And even if you don't meet many
                    big animals, the orchids, birds, waterfalls and sense of adventure that inevitably arises when
                    hiking in the jungle guarantee a good day out. Khao Yai's mix of scenery and accessibility is hard
                    to beat. </p>

                <p>
                    On South Americaâ€™s southern frontier, nature grows wild, barren and beautiful. Spaces are large, as
                    are the silences that fill them. For the newly arrived, such emptiness can be as impressive as the
                    sight of Patagoniaâ€™s jagged peaks, pristine rivers and dusty backwater oases. In its enormous scale,
                    Patagonia offers a wealth of potential experiences and landscapes.

                    Though now mostly paved, lonely RN 40 remains the iconic highway that stirred affection in
                    personalities as disparate as Butch Cassidy and Bruce Chatwin. On the eastern seaboard, paved RN 3
                    shoots south, connecting oil boomtowns with ancient petrified forests, Welsh settlements and the
                    incredible PenÃ­nsula ValdÃ©s. Then there is the other, trendy Patagonia where faux-fur hoodies
                    outnumber the guanacos. Donâ€™t miss the spectacular sights of El Calafate and El ChaltÃ©n, but
                    remember that theyâ€™re a world apart from the whistling solitude of the steppe.

            <div class="guide__text">
                <p><span class="highlight">El ChaltÃ©n - </span>
                    This colorful village overlooks the stunning northern sector of Parque Nacional Los Glaciares. Every
                    summer thousands of trekkers explore the world-class trails that start right here. Founded in 1985,
                    in a rush to beat Chile to the land claim, El ChaltÃ©n is still a frontier town, albeit an offbeat
                    one, featuring constant construction, hippie values and packs of roaming dogs. Every year more
                    mainstream tourists come to see what the fuss is about, but in winter (Mayâ€“September) most hotels
                    and services board up and transportation links are few. El ChaltÃ©n is named for Cerro Fitz Royâ€™s
                    Tehuelche name, meaning â€˜peak of fireâ€™ or â€˜smoking mountainâ€™ â€“ an apt description of the
                    cloud-enshrouded summit. Perito Moreno and Carlos Moyano later named it after the Beagleâ€™s Captain
                    FitzRoy, who navigated Darwinâ€™s expedition up the RÃ­o Santa Cruz in 1834, coming within 50km of the
                    cordillera.
                </p>
                <p><span class="highlight">Glaciar Perito Moreno - </span>
                    Among the Earth's most dynamic and accessible ice fields, Glaciar Perito Moreno is the stunning
                    centerpiece of the southern sector of Parque Nacional Los Glaciares. Locally referred to as Glaciar
                    Moreno, it measures 30km long, 5km wide and 60m high, but what makes it exceptional in the world of
                    ice is its constant advance â€“ up to 2m per day, causing building-sized icebergs to calve from its
                    face. </p>
                <p><span class="highlight">Cerro Fitz Roy - </span>
                    This surreal and stunning mountain landscape defies all logic. In the northern part of the park, the
                    Fitz Roy Range â€“ with its rugged wilderness and shark-tooth summits â€“ is the de facto trekking
                    capital of Argentina. It also draws world-class climbers for whom Cerro Torre and Cerro Fitz Roy are
                    milestone ascents notorious for brutal weather conditions. But you donâ€™t have to be extreme to enjoy
                    the numerous well-marked trails for hiking and jaw-dropping scenery â€“ that is, when the clouds
                    clear.

                <p>
                    It's the power of Icelandic nature to turn the prosaic into the extraordinary. A dip in a pool
                    becomes a soak in a geothermal lagoon; a casual stroll can transform into a trek across a glittering
                    glacier; and a quiet night of camping may mean front-row seats to the aurora borealisâ€™ curtains of
                    light, or the soft, pinkish hue of the midnight sun. Iceland has a transformative effect on people
                    too â€“ its sagas turned brutes into poets, and its stories of huldufÃ³lk (hidden people) may make
                    believers out of sceptics. Here you'll find some of the world's highest concentrations of dreamers,
                    authors, artists and musicians, all fuelled by their surrounds.

                    Vast, varied and spectacular, VatnajÃ¶kull National Park was founded in 2008, when authorities
                    created a megapark by joining the 8300-sq-km VatnajÃ¶kull ice cap with two previously established
                    national parks: Skaftafell in southeast Iceland and JÃ¶kulsÃ¡rgljÃºfur in the northeast. The park
                    measures over 14,100 sq km, occupying approximately 14% of the entire country, and its boundaries
                    encircle a staggering richness of landscapes and some of Iceland's greatest natural treasures,
                    created by the combined forces of rivers, glacial ice, and volcanic and geothermal activity.

                    Europeâ€™s last true wilderness areas, covering some of the most extreme parts of Iceland. Itâ€™s a
                    fantastic destination for hiking, with challenging terrain and excellent opportunities for spotting
                    Arctic foxes, seals, whales and teeming bird life. It is essential to plan ahead and get local
                    advice, as vast snow drifts with near-vertical faces can develop on the mountain passes, rivers can
                    become unfordable.

                <p><span class="highlight">Geothermal Blue Lagoon - </span>
                    In a magnificent black-lava field, the cyan Blue Lagoon spa is fed water from the futuristic
                    Svartsengi geothermal plant; with its silver towers, roiling clouds of steam, and people daubed in
                    white silica mud, it's an otherworldly place. Those who say itâ€™s too commercial and too crowded
                    aren't wrong, but youâ€™ll be missing something special if you donâ€™t go. Pre-booking is essential.

                    The superheated water (70% sea water, 30% fresh water, at a perfect 38Â°C) is rich in blue-green
                    algae, mineral salts and fine silica mud, which condition and exfoliate the skin â€“ sounds like
                    advertising speak, but you really do come out as soft as a babyâ€™s bum. The water is hottest near the
                    vents where it emerges, and the surface is several degrees warmer than the bottom. </p>

                <p>
                    Shrouded by mist and surrounded by lush vegetation and steep escarpments, the sprawling Inca citadel
                    of Machu Picchu lives up to every expectation. In a spectacular location, itâ€™s the most famous
                    archaeological site on the continent, a must for all visitors to Peru. Like the Mona Lisa or the
                    pyramids, it has been seared into our collective consciousness, though nothing can diminish the
                    thrill of being here. This awe-inspiring ancient city was never revealed to the conquering Spaniards
                    and was virtually forgotten until the early part of the 20th century.

        <h4 class="guide__subtitle">Things to Do</h3>
            <div class="guide__text">
                <p><span class="highlight">Principal Temple - </span>
                    The â€˜templeâ€™ derives its name from the massive solidity and perfection of its construction. The
                    damage to the rear right corner is the result of the ground settling below this corner rather than
                    any inherent weakness in the masonry itself.
                </p>
                <p><span class="highlight">Intipunku - </span>
                    The Inca Trail ends after its final descent from the notch in the horizon called Intipunku (Sun
                    Gate). Looking at the hill behind you as you enter the ruins, you can see both the trail and
                    Intipunku. This hill, called Machu Picchu (Old Peak), gives the site its name.

                    Access from the Machu Picchu ruins may be restricted. It takes about an hour to reach Intipunku. If
                    you can spare at least a half-day for the round-trip, it may be possible to continue as far as WiÃ±ay
                    Wayna. Expect to pay S15 or more as an unofficial reduced-charge admission fee to the Inca Trail,
                    and be sure to return before 3pm, which is when the checkpoint typically closes.
                </p>
                <p><span class="highlight">Temple of the Sun - </span>
                    Just above and to the left of the ceremonial baths is Machu Picchuâ€™s only round building, a curved
                    and tapering tower of exceptional stonework. This structure is off-limits and best viewed from
                    above.
                </p>
                <p><span class="highlight">Cuzco City - </span>
                    The undisputed archaeological capital of the Americas, Cuzco is the continentâ€™s oldest continuously
                    inhabited city and the gateway to Machu Picchu. Cosmopolitan Cuzco (also Cusco, or Qosqâ€™o in
                    Quechua) thrives with a measure of contradiction. Ornate cathedrals squat over Inca temples, massage
                    hawkers ply the narrow cobblestone passages, a rural Andean woman feeds bottled water to her pet
                    llama while the finest boutiques sell pricey alpaca knits.
